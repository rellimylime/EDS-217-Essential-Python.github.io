## Special Considerations

### "Preview" Activities (Advanced Content as Motivation)
**Not applicable** - This is positioned as practice, not preview

### R-to-Python Comparisons [[memory:4677171]]
‚òëÔ∏è **Potential enhancement**: Data operations could show R equivalents
- `.groupby()` ‚Üî `group_by()` in dplyr
- `.merge()` ‚Üî `join()` functions in dplyr
- `.value_counts()` ‚Üî `count()` in dplyr

### Environment Considerations [[memory:4682787]]
‚ùå **Library dependencies**: seaborn not appropriately introduced yet
‚òëÔ∏è **Core dependencies**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib available

---

## Detailed Issues Analysis

### **Critical Issue 1: seaborn Premature Introduction**
```python
import seaborn as sns  # ‚ùå Not taught until Day 7
```
**Impact**: Students encounter unfamiliar library without context  
**Teaching Sequence**: seaborn first properly introduced in Day 7 visualizations

### **Critical Issue 2: Complex Groupby Operations**
```python
# Very advanced chaining - may be too complex for Day 6
decade_winners = eurovision_df.groupby(['decade', 'to_country'])['points_final'].mean().groupby('decade').idxmax()
```
**Impact**: Combines multiple advanced concepts in single operation
**Complexity**: Multi-level grouping + aggregation + secondary grouping + idxmax

### **Questionable Issue 3: Reset Index Timing**
```python
country_counts = merged_df['to_country'].value_counts().reset_index()
```
**Impact**: Uses method without clear prior teaching
**Need**: Verify when `.reset_index()` is explicitly taught
