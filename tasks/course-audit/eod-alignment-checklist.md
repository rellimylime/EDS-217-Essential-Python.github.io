# EOD Activity Alignment Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures that End-of-Day (EOD) practice activities only use concepts, methods, and libraries that have been taught in that day's sessions or previous days.

## Pre-Flight Checklist Template

**Activity:** Day X EOD Practice  
**Reviewer:** [Name]  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Status:** ☐ Aligned ☐ Issues Found ☐ Major Revision Needed

---

### ✅ Python Fundamentals
☐ All data types used have been introduced (str, int, float, bool, list, dict, etc.)  
☐ All Python syntax patterns are previously taught (loops, conditionals, functions)  
☐ All built-in functions have been covered (print, len, type, range, etc.)  
☐ Variable assignment and naming conventions match taught practices  

### ✅ Libraries and Imports
☐ All pandas methods used have been taught in prior sessions  
☐ All visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) have been introduced  
☐ All NumPy functions are previously covered  
☐ All external libraries are imported and their purpose explained  
☐ Library aliases (pd, np, plt) have been established  

### ✅ Pandas-Specific Concepts
☐ DataFrame creation and structure concepts are covered  
☐ All data loading methods (`read_csv`, parameters) are taught  
☐ Data exploration methods (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`) are covered  
☐ All selection and filtering techniques are previously demonstrated  
☐ All aggregation methods (`groupby()`, `sum()`, etc.) are taught  
☐ All data manipulation methods are covered  

### ✅ Visualization Concepts
☐ Basic plotting concepts are introduced  
☐ All plot types used have been demonstrated  
☐ Plot customization features have been covered  
☐ Figure and axes concepts are explained (if used)  

### ✅ Concept Complexity and Progression
☐ Data manipulation concepts match current skill level  
☐ Dataset complexity is appropriate for day's learning  
☐ Problem-solving approach aligns with taught methods  
☐ No "surprise" advanced concepts appear without warning  
☐ Builds incrementally on previous days' skills  

### ✅ Learning Pedagogy
☐ Activity matches expected difficulty curve for the day  
☐ Instructions are clear for current skill level  
☐ Adequate scaffolding provided for new concept combinations  
☐ Appropriate balance of guided vs. independent work

## Special Considerations

### "Preview" Activities (Advanced Content as Motivation)
If the activity intentionally shows advanced concepts as a preview:

☐ Clear "Coming Attractions" framing is present  
☐ Students are told explicitly this is a preview  
☐ Timeline showing when concepts will be taught is provided  
☐ Copy/paste instructions are emphasized  
☐ "Don't worry about understanding this yet" messaging is clear  

### R-to-Python Comparisons [[memory:4677171]]
☐ Appropriate R command comparisons are included  
☐ Background information about data sources is provided  
☐ Sufficient context for students with R background  

### Environment Considerations [[memory:4682787]]
☐ All required packages are in environment.yml  
☐ Core dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter) are available  
☐ Python version compatibility (3.11) verified
