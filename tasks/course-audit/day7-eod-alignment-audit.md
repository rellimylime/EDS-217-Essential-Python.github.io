## Notes

Day 7 EOD represents **critical verification point** for course library introduction sequence:

### **Key Verification Requirements**

1. **Session 7b seaborn introduction**: Must properly introduce seaborn library before EOD
2. **Visualization method coverage**: Sessions 7b/7c must cover EOD seaborn methods
3. **Library progression validation**: Confirms matplotlib (Day 4+) → seaborn (Day 7) sequence

### **Impact on Course Quality**

**If verification confirms proper introduction**:
- ✅ **Validates Day 5/6 revisions** - seaborn removal was correct timing
- ✅ **Confirms library sequence** - proper progression throughout course
- ✅ **Establishes Day 7 as capstone** - visualization skills culmination

**Critical success factors**:
- **Comprehensive seaborn introduction** in Session 7b
- **Practical application** in Session 7c
- **Real-world dataset** provides excellent context

Day 7 audit will determine whether the course has achieved **excellent library introduction timing** or requires adjustment to maintain alignment quality.
