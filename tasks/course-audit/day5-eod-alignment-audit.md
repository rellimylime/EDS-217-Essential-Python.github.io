## Special Considerations

### "Preview" Activities (Advanced Content as Motivation)
**Not applicable** - This is positioned as practice, not preview

### R-to-Python Comparisons [[memory:4677171]]
☑️ **Potential enhancement**: Data analysis operations could show R equivalents
- DataFrame operations ↔ data.frame operations in R
- `.filter()` ↔ `dplyr::filter()` in R
- `.sort_values()` ↔ `arrange()` in R

### Environment Considerations [[memory:4682787]]
❌ **Library dependencies**: seaborn not appropriately introduced in curriculum
☑️ **Core dependencies**: pandas, numpy available from previous days

---

## Detailed Issues Analysis

### **Critical Issue 1: seaborn Premature Introduction**
```python
import seaborn as sns  # ❌ Not taught until Day 7 Session 7b
```
**Impact**: Students encounter unfamiliar library without context
**Teaching Sequence**: seaborn first appears in Day 7 visualizations

### **Critical Issue 2: Advanced pandas Methods**
```python
df.set_index('entity', inplace=True)  # ❌ Day 6 concept (Sessions 6a, 6c)
```
**Impact**: Uses indexing concepts not yet covered
**Teaching Sequence**: `.set_index()` taught in Day 6 sessions

### **Questionable Issue 3: Column Dropping**
```python
df.drop(['year', 'Banana values', 'type'], axis='columns')  # ❓ When taught?
```
**Impact**: May use method before instruction
**Need**: Verify when column removal is explicitly taught
