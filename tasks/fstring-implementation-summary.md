# F-String Standardization - Implementation Summary
**Priority 1 Implementation Completed**

## üéâ **Successfully Completed Tasks**

### ‚úÖ **1. Comprehensive Educational Content Added**
**File**: `course-materials/interactive-sessions/1c_variables_strings.qmd`
**Changes**: Added comprehensive "String Formatting in Python: What You'll Encounter in the Wild" section including:

- **Complete comparison** of all 4 formatting approaches (concatenation, %, .format(), f-strings)
- **Clear explanations** of why f-strings are the modern standard
- **R-to-Python comparisons** for students with R background [[memory:4677171]]
- **Data science specific examples** with number formatting
- **Practice exercises** to convert older code to f-strings
- **Performance and readability benefits** clearly explained

### ‚úÖ **2. Core Code Examples Modernized**
**File**: `course-materials/interactive-sessions/3c_arrays_and_series.qmd`
**Changes**: Updated string formatting in NumPy and pandas examples:

```python
# Before:
print("Array + 2:", arr_1d + 2)
print("Mean:", np.mean(arr_1d))

# After:
print(f"Array + 2: {arr_1d + 2}")
print(f"Mean: {np.mean(arr_1d):.2f}")
```

**File**: Same file - pandas Series examples:
```python
# Before:
print("\nSeries + 5:\n", s2 + 5)

# After:
print(f"\nSeries + 5:\n{s2 + 5}")
```

### ‚úÖ **3. Cheat Sheet Modernized**
**File**: `course-materials/cheatsheets/first_steps.ipynb`
**Changes**: Updated string examples to show both approaches:

```python
# Modern approach (f-strings) - PREFERRED
print(f"{hello} {world}")

# Older approach (string concatenation) - you'll see this in code
print(hello + " " + world)
```
