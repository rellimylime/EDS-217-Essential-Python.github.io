## Course Description

Programming skills are critical when working with, understanding, analyzing, and gleaning insights from environmental data. In the intensive EDS 217 course, students will develop fundamental skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and data visualization, specifically tailored for environmental data science applications.

The goal of EDS 217 (Python for Environmental Data Science) is to equip incoming MEDS students with the programming methods, skills, notation, and language commonly used in the python data science stack, which will be essential for their python-based data science courses and projects in the program as well as in their data science careers. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Manipulate and analyze data using libraries like pandas and NumPy

- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn

- Write, interpret, and debug Python scripts

- Implement basic algorithms for data processing

- Utilize logical operations, control flow, and functions in programming

- Collaborate with peers to solve group programming tasks, and communicate the process and results to the rest of the class
