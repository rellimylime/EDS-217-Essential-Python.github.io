## Variable Inspection in JupyterLab

### Installing the Variable Inspector Extension

Before we can use the Variable Inspector in JupyterLab, we need to install the extension. Follow these steps:

1. Start a new JupyterLab session in your web browser.

2. Click on the "+" button in the top left corner to open the Launcher (it might already be opened).

3. Under "Other", click on "Terminal" to open a new terminal session.

4. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

   ```
   pip install lckr-jupyterlab-variableinspector
   ```

5. Wait for the installation to complete. You should see a message indicating successful installation.

6. Once the installation is complete, you need to restart JupyterLab for the changes to take effect. To do this:
   - Save all your open notebooks and files.
   - Close all browser tabs with JupyterLab.
   - Login to `https://workbench-1.bren.ucsb.edu` again.
   - Restart a JupyterLab session

After restarting JupyterLab, the Variable Inspector extension should be available for use.

### Variable Inspector

Now that you have installed the Variable Inspector extension, here's how to use it:

Open the Variable Inspector:
- Menu: View > Activate Command Palette, then type "variable inspector"
- Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + I (Mac)
- Right-click in an open notebook and select "Open Variable Inspector" (will be at the bottom of the list)

The Variable Inspector shows:
- Variable names
- Types
- Values/shapes
- Count (for collections)

:::{.callout-warning title="Limits to the Variable Inspector"}
**The variable inspector is not suitable for use with large dataframes or large arrays**. You should use standard commands like `df.head()`, `df.tail()`, `df.info()`, `df.describe()` to inspect large dataframes.
:::


```{python}
#| echo: true

# Example variables
x = 5
y = "Hello"
z = [1, 2, 3]

# These will appear in the Variable Inspector
```

## Essential Magic Commands

Magic commands start with `%` (line magics) or `%%` (cell magics). Note that available magic commands may vary depending on your Jupyter environment and installed extensions.

### Viewing Variables

```{python}
#| echo: true

# List all variables
%whos

# List just variable names
%who
```

### Running Shell Commands

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Run a shell command
!echo "Hello from the shell!"

# Capture output in a variable
files = !ls
print(files)
```

## Tips for Beginners

1. Use Tab for code completion
3. Add `?` after a function name for more detailed help (e.g., `print?`)
4. Use `dir()` to see available attributes/methods (e.g., `dir(str)`)
5. Use the `help()` command to get information about functions and objects.
