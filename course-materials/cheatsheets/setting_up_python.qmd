This guide will help you set up Python 3.11 and JupyterLab on your local machine using Miniconda. We'll also install core data science libraries.

## Step 0: Opening a Terminal

Before we begin, you'll need to know how to open a terminal (command-line interface) on your operating system:

### For Windows:
1. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter.
   Alternatively, search for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu.

### For macOS:
1. Press Command + Space to open Spotlight Search.
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter.
   Alternatively, go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

### For Linux:
1. Most Linux distributions use Ctrl + Alt + T as a keyboard shortcut to open the terminal.
2. You can also search for "Terminal" in your distribution's application menu.

## Step 1: Download and Install Miniconda

### For Windows:
1. Download the Miniconda installer for Windows from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
3. During installation, make sure to add Miniconda to your PATH environment variable when prompted.

### For macOS:
1. Download the Miniconda installer for macOS from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
   ```
4. Follow the prompts and accept the license agreement.

### For Linux:
1. Download the Miniconda installer for Linux from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
4. Follow the prompts and accept the license agreement.

## Step 2: Set up Python 3.11 and Core Libraries

Open a new terminal or command prompt window to ensure the Miniconda installation is recognized.

Run the following commands:

```
conda install python=3.11
conda install jupyter jupyterlab numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

This will install Python 3.11, JupyterLab, and the core data science libraries in your base environment.

## Alternative: Create a Dedicated EDS 217 Environment

For better package management, you can create a dedicated conda environment for this course:

```
# Create a new environment specifically for EDS 217
conda create -n eds217_2025 python=3.11

# Activate the environment
conda activate eds217_2025

# Install packages in the dedicated environment
conda install jupyter jupyterlab numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn

# Register the environment with Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name eds217_2025 --display-name "Python 3.11 (EDS 217 2025)"
```

When using JupyterLab, you can then select "Python 3.11 (EDS 217 2025)" as your kernel.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

1. To verify that Python 3.11 is installed, run:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

2. To launch JupyterLab, run:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```

This should open JupyterLab in your default web browser. You can now create new notebooks and start coding!

## Additional Notes

- To update Miniconda and installed packages in the future, use:
  ```
  conda update --all
  ```

- While we're using the base environment for this quick setup, it's generally a good practice to create separate environments for different projects. You can explore this concept later as you become more familiar with conda.
