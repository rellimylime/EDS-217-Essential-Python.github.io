# Introduction to Seaborn

`Seaborn` is a powerful Python visualization library that builds on `matplotlib` to create beautiful, high-level statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating insightful and attractive visualizations and is particularly suited for exploratory data analysis.

Origin of `seaborn`

Seaborn is named after [Sam Seaborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Seaborn), a character from the TV show, "[The West Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing)" (1999-2006), who was known for his expert communication skills and strategic thinking.

## Philosophy of Seaborn

Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. 

Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets. 

It tries to automatically perform semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.

## Main Ideas in Seaborn


- **Integration with Pandas**: Works well with Pandas data structures.

- **Built-in Themes**: Provides built-in themes for styling matplotlib graphics.

- **Color Palettes**: Offers a variety of color palettes to reveal patterns in the data.

- **Statistical Estimation**: Seaborn includes functions to fit and visualize linear regression models.



## Major Features of Seaborn

Seaborn simplifies many aspects of creating complex visualizations in Python. Some of its major features include:

- **FacetGrids and PairGrids**: For plotting conditional relationships.
- **Factorplot**: For categorical variables.
- **Jointplot**: For joint distributions.
- **Time Series functionality**: Through functions like `tsplot`.

## Using seaborn

```python
import seaborn as sns
```
Why `sns`?

Why `sns`?

but the monogram was incorrectly designed as "sNs"...

## Theme Options

```python
# Set the theme to whitegrid
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")
```
1. **`darkgrid`**: The default theme. Background is a dark gray grid (not to be confused with a solid gray).
2. **`whitegrid`**: Similar to `darkgrid` but with a lighter background. This theme is particularly useful for plots with dense data points. 

--- 

## Themes (continued)
3. **`dark`**: This theme provides a dark background without any grid lines. It’s suitable for presentations or where visuals are prioritized.
4. **`white`**: Offers a clean, white background without grid lines. This is well in situations where the data and annotations need to stand out without any additional distraction.


5. **`ticks`**: This theme is similar to the `white` theme but adds ticks on the axes, which enhances the precision of interpreting the data. 

## Getting ready to Seaborn

### Import the library and set a style

```{python}
#| echo: true
import seaborn as sns # (but now you know it should have been ssn 🤓)
sns.set(style="darkgrid") # This is the default, so skip it if wanted
```

---

### Relational Plots (relplot)

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Load the built-in example tips dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a relational plot
sns.relplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips, kind="line")
```

---

### Categorical Plots (catplot)

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Load the example titanic dataset
titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
# Create a categorical plot
sns.catplot(x="deck", kind="count", data=titanic)
```

---

### Categorical Plots (catplot)

The `palette` keyword specifies the [category color scale](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html)

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Create a categorical plot
sns.catplot(x="deck", kind="count", palette="coolwarm", data=titanic)
```

---

### Distribution Plots (displot)

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Create a distribution plot
sns.set(style="ticks") 
sns.displot(tips['total_bill'], kde=True)
```

---

### Regression Plots (regplot)

```{python}
#| echo: true
sns.set(style="dark") 
# Create a regression plot
sns.regplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)
```

## Conclusion

Seaborn is a versatile and powerful tool for statistical data visualization in Python. Whether you need to visualize the distribution of a dataset, the relationship between multiple variables, or the dependencies between categorical data, Seaborn has a plot type to make your analysis more intuitive and insightful.
