Understanding the types of variables and the methods available for different objects is crucial for effective programming in Python. This guide will walk you through how to determine the type of a variable and explore the methods you can use with various objects.

## Variable Types

In Python, **everything is an object**. Each object has a specific type, and knowing the type of a variable helps you understand what operations and methods you can perform on it.

### Determining Variable Type

To find out the type of a variable, you can use the `type()` function. This function returns the type of the object passed to it.

```{python}
#| include-output: false

# Define some variables
number = 42
text = "Hello, World!"
pi = 3.14159
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Determine the type of each variable
print(type(number))
print(type(text))
print(type(pi))
print(type(data))
```

### Built-in Types

Here are some common built-in types in Python:

- `int`: Represents integers.
- `float`: Represents floating-point numbers.
- `str`: Represents strings.
- `list`: Represents lists, which are ordered collections of items.

## Exploring Methods

Once you know the type of an object, you can discover the methods available for that object. Methods are functions that belong to an object and can be used to perform operations on the data contained within the object.

### Discovering Methods

You can use the `dir()` function to list all the attributes and methods available for an object. This function returns a list of the object's attributes and methods, including special methods (also known as "dunder" methods) that begin and end with double underscores.

```{python}
#| include-output: false

# List all methods and attributes of a string object
string_methods = dir(text)
print(string_methods)
```

### Filtering User-Facing Methods

While `dir()` lists all methods, you often only need user-facing methods. You can filter out special methods by ignoring those with double underscores.

```{python}
#| include-output: false

# Filter out special methods
user_methods = [method for method in dir(text) if not method.startswith('__')]
print(user_methods)
```

## Using Methods

Now that you've discovered the methods available for an object, let's see how to use them. Here are some examples with strings and lists.

### String Methods

Strings in Python have various methods for text manipulation. Let's look at a few commonly used methods.

#### Example: `upper()`, `lower()`, and `replace()`, `strip()`

```{python}
#| include-output: false

text = " Hello, World!  "

# Convert to uppercase
print(text.upper())

# Convert to lowercase
print(text.lower())

# Replace a substring
print(text.replace("World", "Python"))

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace, including tabs and newlines
print(text.strip())

```


#### Advanced Example: String Normalization

In this section, we'll explore how to normalize strings using built-in Python string methods. String normalization is a common task in data processing and can involve operations like converting text to lowercase, removing extra whitespace, and replacing spaces with other characters. For example, in `R`, the janitor package is often used to normalize dataframe columns names. 

##### Basic String Normalization

Let's start with a simple example of string normalization:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# A string with mixed case and extra spaces
original = "  Hello, World!  "

# Normalize the string using the .strip() method to remove whitespace 
# and the .lower() method to convert to lowercase
normalized = original.strip().lower()

print(f"Original: '{original}'")
print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
```

In this example, we used two string methods:
- `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace
- `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase

#### Advanced String Normalization

Now, let's look at a more comprehensive approach to string normalization:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Examples of strings to normalize
examples = [
    "Hello World",
    "  Python Programming  ",
    "STRING NORMALIZATION\n",
    "  Trim  Spaces  ",
    "\tTabs and Newlines\n"
]

print("String Normalization Examples:")
print("==============================")

for original in examples:
    # Normalize the string:
    # 1. Remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines
    # 2. Convert to lowercase
    # 3. Replace internal whitespace with underscores
    normalized = original.strip().lower().replace(" ", "_")
    
    print(f"Original: '{original}'")
    print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
    print()
```

In this advanced example, we:

1. Start with `strip()` to remove all leading and trailing whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. Use `lower()` to convert the string to lowercase.
3. Finally, apply `replace(" ", "_")` to substitute internal spaces with underscores.

#### Exercise

Now it's your turn to practice! Modify the code below to normalize the given strings according to these rules:

1. Remove leading and trailing whitespace
2. Convert to _uppercase_ (instead of lowercase)
3. Replace spaces with _hyphens_

```{python}
#| echo: true

strings_to_normalize = [
    "data science",
    "  MACHINE learning ",
    "Artificial Intelligence\t",
    " Natural\nLanguage Processing "
]

print("Your Normalized Strings:")
print("========================")

for string in strings_to_normalize:
    # Your normalization code here
    normalized = string  # Replace this line with your normalization steps!
    
    print(f"Original: '{string}'")
    print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
    print()
```


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

print("Solution:")
print("=========")

for string in strings_to_normalize:
    normalized = string.strip().upper().replace(" ", "-")
    
    print(f"Original: '{string}'")
    print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
    print()
```

Try experimenting with different normalization techniques or adding your own strings to the list!

### List Methods

Lists also have several useful methods for data manipulation. Here are some examples.

#### Example: `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`

```{python}
#| include-output: false

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]

# Append an item
numbers.append(2)
print(numbers)

# Remove an item
numbers.remove(1)  # Removes the first occurrence of 1
print(numbers)

# Sort the list
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```

## Special Methods

Special methods, also known as "dunder" (double underscore) methods, allow you to define the behavior of your objects for built-in operations. For example, `__init__` is used for initializing objects, and `__str__` defines the string representation.

While important, these are generally more advanced and used in object-oriented programming, so we will not focus on them in this introductory course.

## Conclusion

This guide has introduced you to determining variable types and exploring the methods available for different objects in Python. By understanding how to discover and use methods, you'll be better equipped to manipulate data and build powerful programs.

Feel free to experiment with the code examples interactively in your Jupyter notebook to deepen your understanding.
