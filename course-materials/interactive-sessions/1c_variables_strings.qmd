Let's begin our interactive session!

## Variable Types

In Python, **everything is an object**. Each object has a specific type, and knowing the type of a variable helps you understand what operations and methods you can perform on it.

### Determining Variable Type

To find out the type of a variable, you can use the `type()` function. This function returns the type of the object passed to it.

```{python}
#| include-output: false

# Define some variables
number = 42
text = "Hello, World!"
pi = 3.14159
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Determine the type of each variable
print(type(number))
print(type(text))
print(type(pi))
print(type(data))
```

### Built-in Types

Here are some common built-in types in Python:

- `int`: Represents integers.
- `float`: Represents floating-point numbers.
- `str`: Represents strings.
- `list`: Represents lists, which are ordered collections of items.

## Exploring Methods

Once you know the type of an object, you can discover the methods available for that object. Methods are functions that belong to an object and can be used to perform operations on the data contained within the object.

### Discovering Methods

You can use the `dir()` function to list all the attributes and methods available for an object. This function returns a list of the object's attributes and methods, including special methods (also known as "dunder" methods) that begin and end with double underscores.

```{python}
#| include-output: false

# List all methods and attributes of a string object
string_methods = dir(text)
print(string_methods)
```

### Filtering User-Facing Methods

While `dir()` lists all methods, you often only need user-facing methods. You can filter out special methods by ignoring those with double underscores.

```{python}
#| include-output: false

# Filter out special methods
user_methods = [method for method in dir(text) if not method.startswith('__')]
print(user_methods)
```

## Using Methods

Now that you've discovered the methods available for an object, let's see how to use them. Here are some examples with strings and lists.

### String Methods

Strings in Python have various methods for text manipulation. Let's look at a few commonly used methods.

#### Example: `upper()`, `lower()`, and `replace()`, `strip()`

```{python}
#| include-output: false

text = " Hello, World!  "

# Convert to uppercase
print(text.upper())

# Convert to lowercase
print(text.lower())

# Replace a substring
print(text.replace("World", "Python"))

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace, including tabs and newlines
print(text.strip())

```


#### Advanced Example: String Normalization

In this section, we'll explore how to normalize strings using built-in Python string methods. String normalization is a common task in data processing and can involve operations like converting text to lowercase, removing extra whitespace, and replacing spaces with other characters. For example, in `R`, the `janitor` package is often used to normalize dataframe columns names. 

##### Basic String Normalization

Let's start with a simple example of string normalization:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# A string with mixed case and extra spaces
original = "  Hello, World!  "

# Normalize the string using the .strip() method to remove whitespace 
# and the .lower() method to convert to lowercase
normalized = original.strip().lower()

print(f"Original: '{original}'")
print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
```

In this example, we used two string methods:
- `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace
- `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase

#### Advanced String Normalization

Now, let's look at a more comprehensive approach to string normalization:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Examples of strings to normalize
examples = [
    "Hello World",
    "  Python Programming  ",
    "STRING NORMALIZATION\n",
    "  Trim  Spaces  ",
    "\tTabs and Newlines\n"
]

print("String Normalization Examples:")
print("==============================")

for original in examples:
    # Normalize the string:
    # 1. Remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines
    # 2. Convert to lowercase
    # 3. Replace internal whitespace with underscores
    normalized = original.strip().lower().replace(" ", "_")
    
    print(f"Original: '{original}'")
    print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
    print()
```

In this advanced example, we:

1. Start with `strip()` to remove all leading and trailing whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. Use `lower()` to convert the string to lowercase.
3. Finally, apply `replace(" ", "_")` to substitute internal spaces with underscores.

#### Exercise

Now it's your turn to practice! Modify the code below to normalize the given strings according to these rules:

1. Remove leading and trailing whitespace
2. Convert to _uppercase_ (instead of lowercase)
3. Replace spaces with _hyphens_

```{python}
#| echo: true

strings_to_normalize = [
    "data science",
    "  MACHINE learning ",
    "Artificial Intelligence\t",
    " Natural\nLanguage Processing "
]

print("Your Normalized Strings:")
print("========================")

for string in strings_to_normalize:
    # Your normalization code here
    normalized = string  # Replace this line with your normalization steps!
    
    print(f"Original: '{string}'")
    print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
    print()
```


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

print("Solution:")
print("=========")

for string in strings_to_normalize:
    normalized = string.strip().upper().replace(" ", "-")
    
    print(f"Original: '{string}'")
    print(f"Normalized: '{normalized}'")
    print()
```

Try experimenting with different normalization techniques or adding your own strings to the list!

### List Methods

Lists also have several useful methods for data manipulation. Here are some examples.

#### Example: `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`

```{python}
#| include-output: false

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]

# Append an item
numbers.append(2)
print(numbers)

# Remove an item
numbers.remove(1)  # Removes the first occurrence of 1
print(numbers)

# Sort the list
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```

## String Formatting in Python: What You'll Encounter in the Wild

An essential skill in data science is creating clear, readable output. Python offers several ways to format strings, and you'll encounter all of them in real-world code. Let's explore these approaches, focusing on the modern best practice.

### The Different Approaches

Here's a practical example showing all the string formatting methods you might see:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Example data - like what you'd use in data science
name = "Alice"
age = 25
score = 87.543

print("=== Different String Formatting Approaches ===")
print()

# 1. String concatenation (you'll see this, but avoid it)
print("Method 1 - String Concatenation (avoid this):")
print("Student: " + name + " is " + str(age) + " years old")
print("Problems: messy, requires str() conversion, hard to read")
print()

# 2. % formatting (old style, still in legacy code)
print("Method 2 - % Formatting (legacy code):")
print("Student: %s is %d years old with %.1f%% score" % (name, age, score))
print("You'll see this in older code and some libraries")
print()

# 3. .format() method (better than %, still common)
print("Method 3 - .format() Method (common in existing code):")
print("Student: {} is {} years old with {:.1f}% score".format(name, age, score))
print("Student: {name} is {age} years old with {score:.1f}% score".format(name=name, age=age, score=score))
print("Better than %, but still verbose")
print()

# 4. F-strings (MODERN APPROACH - use this!)
print("Method 4 - F-strings (MODERN - use this!):")
print(f"Student: {name} is {age} years old with {score:.1f}% score")
print(f"Temperature reading: {score:.2f}¬∞C")
print(f"Data points processed: {age * 1000:,}")
print("‚úÖ Most readable, fastest, and Pythonic!")
```

### Why F-strings are the Modern Standard

F-strings (formatted string literals) are the preferred approach in modern Python because they are:

- **More readable**: Variables appear directly in the string
- **Faster**: Better performance than other methods  
- **More concise**: Less typing and fewer parentheses
- **Feature-rich**: Easy number formatting, expressions, and method calls

:::{.callout-tip title="R vs Python: String Formatting"}
If you're coming from R, here are the equivalent approaches:

**R approaches:**
```r
# R methods
sprintf("Student: %s scored %.1f%%", name, score)
paste("Hello", name, "- you scored", score)
paste0("Temperature: ", temp, "¬∞C")
```

**Python f-string equivalents:**
```python
# Modern Python f-strings
f"Student: {name} scored {score:.1f}%"
f"Hello {name} - you scored {score}"
f"Temperature: {temp}¬∞C"
```

F-strings are similar to R's `sprintf()` but more intuitive, and much cleaner than `paste()`!
:::

### F-string Formatting Examples for Data Science

Here are common formatting patterns you'll use in data analysis:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Common data science formatting patterns
temperature = 23.456789
count = 1234567
percentage = 0.847

print("=== Data Science F-string Patterns ===")
print()

# Number formatting
print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f}¬∞C")  # 2 decimal places
print(f"Data points: {count:,}")           # Thousands separator
print(f"Success rate: {percentage:.1%}")   # Percentage formatting
print()

# Dynamic formatting
precision = 3
print(f"Precise temperature: {temperature:.{precision}f}¬∞C")
print()

# Expressions in f-strings
values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(f"Dataset has {len(values)} values with mean {sum(values)/len(values):.1f}")
print()

# Multiple variables with formatting
for i, val in enumerate(values[:3], 1):
    print(f"Sample {i:2d}: {val:5.1f} (squared: {val**2:6.1f})")
```

### Practice Exercise

Try updating this older-style code to use modern f-strings:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Convert these to f-strings
city = "Santa Barbara"
temp_f = 72
temp_c = (temp_f - 32) * 5/9

# Old style (update these!):
print("Weather in " + city + ":")
print("Temperature: %d¬∞F (%.1f¬∞C)" % (temp_f, temp_c))

# Your f-string versions here:
# print(f"???")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

# Solution:
print(f"Weather in {city}:")
print(f"Temperature: {temp_f}¬∞F ({temp_c:.1f}¬∞C)")
```

## Special Methods

Special methods, also known as "dunder" (double underscore) methods, allow you to define the behavior of your objects for built-in operations. For example, `__init__` is used for initializing objects, and `__str__` defines the string representation.

While important, these are generally more advanced and used in object-oriented programming, so we will not focus on them in this introductory course.

## Conclusion

This guide has introduced you to determining variable types and exploring the methods available for different objects in Python. By understanding how to discover and use methods, you'll be better equipped to manipulate data and build powerful programs.
