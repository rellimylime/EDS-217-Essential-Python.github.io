Python has four collection data types, the most common of which is the **list**. This session introduces lists and a few of the important list operations. We will also cover **indexing**, a key feature of programming.


## Getting Started

Before we begin our interactive session, please follow these steps to set up your Jupyter Notebook:

1. Open JupyterLab and create a new notebook:
   - Click on the `+` button in the top left corner
   - Select `Python 3.11.0` from the Notebook options

2. Rename your notebook:
   - Right-click on the `Untitled.ipynb` tab
   - Select "Rename"
   - Name your notebook with the format: `Session_2A_Lists.ipynb`
     
3. Add a title cell:
   - In the first cell of your notebook, change the cell type to "Markdown"
   - Add the following content (replace the placeholders with the actual information):

```markdown
# Day 2: Session A - Lists

[Link to session webpage](https://eds-217-essential-python.github.io/course-materials/interactive-sessions/2a_lists.html)

Date: 09/03/2025
```

4. Add a code cell:
   - Below the title cell, add a new cell
   - Ensure it's set as a "Code" cell
   - This will be where you start writing your Python code for the session

5. Throughout the session:
   - Take notes in Markdown cells
   - Copy or write code in Code cells
   - Run cells to test your code
   - Ask questions if you need clarification

## Lists

A list is a Python object used to contain multiple values. Lists are ordered and changeable. They are defined as follows:

::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
# Define list variables
num_list = [4, 23, 654, 2, 0, -12, 4391]
str_list = ['energy', 'water', 'carbon']
```

While you can create lists containing mixed data types, this is not usually recommended.

The `len()` command returns the length of the list.

```{python}
len(str_list)
```

The `min()` and `max()` commands are used to find the minimum and maximum values in a list. For a list of strings, this corresponds to the alphabetically first and last elements.

```{python}
min(str_list)
```

```{python}
max(str_list)
```


:::{.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Use the `len()`, `min()`, and `max()` commands to find the length, minimum, and maximum of `num_list`.
:::


### Indexing
The index is used to reference a value in an iterable object by its position. To access an element in a list by its index, use square brackets `[]`.

:::{.callout-note}
üêç Python is **zero-indexed**. This means that the first element in the list is 0, the second is 1, and so on. The last element in a list with $n$ elements is $n - 1$.
::: 

```python
num_list = [4, 23, 654, 2, 0, -12, 4391]
```

```{python}
num_list[2]
```

You can also access an element based on its position from the end of the list.
```python
num_list = [4, 23, 654, 2, 0, -12, 4391]
```

```{python}
num_list[-2]
```

:::{.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Find the 2nd element in `str_list` in two different ways. Remember that Python is zero-indexed!
:::

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
print(str_list)
print(str_list[1])
print(str_list[-2])
```

### Slicing
Accessing a range of values in a list is called **slicing**. A slice specifies a start and an endpoint, generating a new list based on the indices. The indices are separated by a `:`.

:::{.callout-note}    
üêç The endpoint index in the slice is <i>exclusive</i>. To slice to the end of the list, omit an endpoint.
:::

```python
num_list = [4, 23, 654, 2, 0, -12, 4391]
```

This code returns the 2nd and 3rd elements of the `num_list`

```{python}
num_list[2:4]
```

This code would return everything from the 4th element to the end of the list:
```{python}
num_list[3:]
```

::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Before running each of the following commands in a new cell in your notebook, try to determine what output you expect
:::


```python
num_list = [4, 23, 654, 2, 0, -12, 4391]
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
num_list[2:6]
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
num_list[0:4]   
```
```{python}
#| eval: false
num_list[:4]    
```
```{python}
#| eval: false
num_list[-6:-1] 
```

Although less common, it is also possible to specify a step size, i.e. `[start:stop:step]`. A step size of 1 would select every element, 2 would select every other element, etc...

```{python}
num_list[0:4:2]  
```

```{python}
num_list[::2]
```
A step of -1 returns the list in reverse.

```{python}
num_list[::-1]
```

### String indicies

Like lists, strings can also be indexed using the same notation. This can be useful for many applications, such as selecting files in a certain folder for import based on their names or extension.


::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
word_str = 'antidisestablishmentarianism'
```

```{python}
word_str[14]
```

```{python}
word_str[::3]
```

  
### List Operations
Elements can be added to a list using the command `list.append()`.


::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::


```{python}
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'white', 'pink']
```


You can **add** an element to a list in a specific position using the command `list.insert(i, x)` where `i` is the position where the element `x` should be added.

<div class="example">
‚úèÔ∏è <b> Try it. </b> 
Add <code>'purple'</code> to the list <code>colors</code> between <code>'green'</code> and <code>'black'</code>.
</div>

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false 
colors.insert(3, 'purple')
print(colors)
```


There are multiple ways to **remove** elements from a list. The commands `list.pop()` and `del` remove elements based on indices.

```python
colors.pop()       # removes the last element
colors.pop(2)      # removes the third element
del colors[2]      # removes the third element
del colors[2:4]    # removes the third and fourth elements
```
The command `list.remove()` removes an element based on its value.
```python
colors.remove('red')
print(colors)
>>> ['blue', 'green', 'black', 'purple', 'white', 'pink']
```

### Let's reset our color list:

```{python}
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'purple', 'black', 'white', 'pink']
```


<div class="example">
‚úèÔ∏è <b> Try it. </b> 
Remove <code>pink</code> and <code>purple</code> from <code>colors</code>, using <code>del</code> for one of the strings and <code>list.remove()</code> for the other.
</div>

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
colors.remove('pink')
del colors[3]
print(colors)
```


### Sorting Lists 

You can **sort** the elements in a list (numerically or alphabetically) in two ways. The first uses the command `list.sort()`.


::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::


```{python}
rand_list = [5.1 , 3.42 , 3.333 , 100.4 , 0.5 , 26.0 , 7.44 , 5.8 , 39.0]
rand_list.sort()
print(rand_list)
```

Setting `reverse=True` within this command sorts the list in reverse order:

::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
rand_list = [5.1 , 3.42 , 3.333 , 100.4 , 0.5 , 26.0 , 7.44 , 5.8 , 39.0]
rand_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(rand_list)
```

So far, all of the list commands we've used have been **in-place operators**. This means that they perform the operation to the variable in place without requiring a new variable to be assigned. By contrast, **standard operators** do not change the original list variable. A new variable must be set in order to retain the operation.

<div class="example">
‚úèÔ∏è <b> Try it. </b> 
Verify that <code>rand_list</code> was, in fact, sorted in place by using the <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> functions to determine the minmum and maximum values in the list and printing the first and last values in the list.
</div>

```{python}
# Step 1: Use f-strings to print the min and max values in rand_list.

# Step 2: Use f-strings to print the first and last values in rand_list.
```

The other method of sorting a list is to use the `sorted()` command, which does not change the original list. Instead, the sorted list must be assigned to a new variable.
```{python}
rand_list = [5.1 , 3.42 , 3.333 , 100.4 , 0.5 , 26.0 , 7.44 , 5.8 , 39.0]
sorted_list = sorted(rand_list)
print(rand_list[0])
print(sorted_list[0])
```

To avoid changing the original variable when using an in-place operator, it is wise to create a copy. There are multiple ways to create copies of lists, but it is important to know the difference between a true **copy** and a **view**. 

:::{.callout-important}
The difference between a `copy` and a `view` is a critical topic in Python and something we will come back to later in the class when working with DataFrames. Python only makes a copy of data when it is necessary, so make sure you understand the difference!
:::

A view of a list can be created as follows:
```{python}
str_list = ['energy', 'water', 'carbon']
str_list_view = str_list
```
Any in-place operation performed on `str_list_view` will also be applied to `str_list`. For example, look what happens when you run this code:

::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
# Sorting the str_list_view...
str_list_view.sort()

# Actually sorts the original str_list!
print(str_list)
```

:::{.callout-important}
**`str_list_view` was just a "view" into to the `str_list` variable, but a copy!**
:::

To avoid this, create a copy of `str_list` using any of the following methods:
```{python}
str_list_copy = str_list.copy()
# or
str_list_copy = str_list[:]
# or
str_list_copy = list(str_list)
```

In addition to adding single elements to a list using `list.append()` or `list.insert()`, multiple elements can be added to a list at the same time by adding multiple lists together.

::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
rainbow  = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']
shades = ['coral', 'chartreuse', 'cyan', 'navy']
print( rainbow + shades )
```

Single lists can be repeated by multiplying by an integer. 


::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
str_list2 = str_list * 2
num_list4 = num_list * 4
print( str_list2 )
print( num_list4 )
```

### Generating sequential lists

Sequential lists are valuable tools, particularly for iteration, which we will explore in later sessions. The `range()` function is used to create an iterable object based on the size of an integer argument.

```python
range(4)
>>> range(0, 4)
```

To construct a sequential list from the `range()` object, use the `list()` function.

```python
list(range(4))
>>> [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

Using multiple integer arguments, the `range()` function can be used to generate sequential lists between two bounds: `range(start, stop [, step])`.

:::{.callout-note}
üêç   Like indexing, all Python functions using <span style="font-style: italic"> start </span> and <span style="font-style: italic"> stop </span> arguments, the <span style="font-style: italic"> stop </span> value is <span style="font-weight: bold"> exclusive </span>.
:::


::: {.example}
‚úèÔ∏è **Try it.** Add the cell below to your notebook and run it.
:::

```{python}
range_10 = list(range(1,11))
odds_10 = list(range(1,11,2))
print(range_10)
print(odds_10)
```
