## Part 1: By hand problems

### Derivative reminder

Biomass (grams) in a reactor over time (hours) is described by: 

::: {.center-text}
$$B(t) = 0.4t^2 + 3.6$$
:::

a. What is the biomass in the reactor after 4 hours?

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
$$B(4) = 0.4(4)^2+3.6 = 106\;grams$$
:::

b. What is the rate at which biomass is changing in the reactor at t = 3.2 hours? 

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
$$\frac{dB}{dt} = (2)(0.4)t$$
$$\frac{dB}{dt} = (2)(0.4)(3.2)$$

$$\frac{dB}{dt} = 2.56 \frac{grams}{hour}$$

### Vector math

For the vectors $\vec a = (1,6)$ and $\vec b = (2, 4)$: 

a. Find and sketch $\vec a + \vec b$

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution

$\vec a + \vec b = (1+2, 6+4) = (3,10)$

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("images/vector-add.jpeg")
```
:::

b. Find and sketch $\vec b - \vec a$

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution

$\vec b - \vec a = (2-1, 4-6) = (-1, -2)$

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("images/vector-subtract.jpeg")
```
:::

c. Find and sketch $2 \vec a$

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution

$2 \vec a = 2 * (1,6) = (2, 12)$

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("images/vector-scale.jpeg")
```
:::

d. Find $\vec a \cdot \vec b$

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
$\vec a \cdot \vec b = (1)(2) + (6)(4) = 26$
:::

## Part 2: Coding practice

a. Create a new project (you may want to name it `eds212-day3-tasks` or something similar)
b. Setup your local and remote repo using `usethis::use_git()` and `usethis::use_github()`
c. In a Quarto doc in your project:
  - Using the `c()` function, create and store two new vectors, called `vec_a` and   `vec_b`, where $\vec a = (1,6)$ and $\vec b = (2, 4)$: 

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
vec_a <- c(1, 6)
vec_b <- c(2, 4)
```
:::

  - Check your by-hand solutions from Part 1 by finding the following in R: 
    - $\vec a + \vec b$
    - $\vec b - \vec a$
    - $2 \vec a$
    - $\vec a \cdot \vec b$
    
::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
vec_a + vec_b
vec_b - vec_a
2 * vec_a
vec_a %*% vec_b
```
:::

d. Save your quarto doc and Render
e. Open the Terminal outside of RStudio
f. Navigate to your project directory using `cd`
c. Use `git status` to check the status
d. Use `git add .` to stage all changes 
e. Use `git commit -m "your commit message here"` to commit to your local repo
f. Use `git pull` to check for remote changes
g. Use `git push` to push changes to your remote repo
h. Go to your remote repo for the project and check to see that the new updates are stored

## Part 3: Fork & clone a repo, use the code

a. Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/EDS-212-Essential-Math/SIR-ODE-example) (which contains a Quarto document with code to numerically solve the SIR equations) to create a version-controlled project
b. Once you've created your project, open the `sir.qmd` file. 
c. Run all code in the .qmd (`Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `Option` + `R`, or go up to the run button and choose the last option "Run All")
d. Explore the code and output graph. What is the code doing? What is the graph telling us? 

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
**The code:**

- Using the expression for slope (here, `sir()`) along with an initial condition (values for `S`, `I`, `R`) and parameter estimates (`beta` = infection parameter, and `gamma` = recovery parameter), the `deSolve::ode()` function calculates values of the solution across equal intervals of time (`times`).

**The graph:**

- The number of susceptible individuals (blue) starts at 100% of the population, then decreases as individuals become affected
- The number of infected individuals (red) initially increases as individuals become infected. This curve peaks when infection rate is the highest, then decreases as infected individuals recover
- The number of recovered individuals (green) starts at 0 then increases over time as infected individuals recover from the disease
:::

e. Make small changes to the parameter values to see how the SIR models change. Are the changes expected? 
f. After trying out a few changes, save and knit your new output graph.
g. Stage, commit, pull, then push to your repo **in the command line**.
h. Check for your changes on GitHub. Are they there? Cool, done with Part 3.
