## Introduction

Welcome to the end-of-day exercise for Day 2! Today, we'll be putting into practice what you've learned about Python data structures, particularly lists and dictionaries. This exercise allows you to work with real data from your colleagues while reinforcing key concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

1. Create and manipulate lists and dictionaries in Python
2. Use list and dictionary methods effectively
3. Iterate through data structures using loops
4. Apply basic data analysis techniques using Python data structures

## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries:

```{python}
#| echo: true
# We won't use the random library until the end of this exercise, 
# but it's always good to put imported libraries at the top of your notebook.
import random 
```

## Part 1: Data Collection

In this first part, we'll create data structures based on information from your colleagues.

### Task 1: Create a List of Colleagues

Create a list containing the names of at least 5 of your colleagues in this course.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
colleagues = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]
print(colleagues)
```

### Task 2: Create a Dictionary of Colleague Information

Now, let's create a dictionary where the keys are your colleagues' names, and the values are another dictionary containing information about them. For each colleague, include the following information:

- Favorite color (`favorite_color`)
- Number of pets (`number_of_pets`)
- Preferred study snack (`preferred_study_snack`)
- Hours of sleep last night (`hours_of_sleep`)

Get this information for at least 5 of your fellow classmates.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
colleague_info = {
    "Alice": {"favorite_color": "blue", "number_of_pets": 2, "preferred_study_snack": "almonds", "hours_of_sleep": 7},
    "Bob": {"favorite_color": "green", "number_of_pets": 0, "preferred_study_snack": "chips", "hours_of_sleep": 6},
    "Charlie": {"favorite_color": "red", "number_of_pets": 1, "preferred_study_snack": "carrots", "hours_of_sleep": 8},
    "David": {"favorite_color": "yellow", "number_of_pets": 3, "preferred_study_snack": "chocolate", "hours_of_sleep": 5},
    "Eve": {"favorite_color": "purple", "number_of_pets": 1, "preferred_study_snack": "popcorn", "hours_of_sleep": 7}
}
print(colleague_info)
```

## Part 2: Data Structure Manipulation

Now that we have our data structures, let's practice manipulating them.

### Task 3: List Operations

Using the list of colleague names you created in Task 1, perform the following operations:

a) Add a new classmate to the end of the list
b) Remove the second classmate from the list
c) Sort the list alphabetically
d) Find and print the index of a specific classmate

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
# a) Add a new colleague
colleagues.append("Frank")
print("After adding Frank:", colleagues)

# b) Remove the second person
removed_colleague = colleagues.pop(1)
print(f"Removed {removed_colleague}. Updated list:", colleagues)

# c) Sort alphabetically
colleagues.sort()
print("Sorted list:", colleagues)

# d) Find index of a specific colleague
charlie_index = colleagues.index("Charlie")
print(f"Index of Charlie: {charlie_index}")
```

### Task 4: Dictionary Operations

Using the dictionary of colleague information from Task 2, perform the following operations:

a) Add a new key-value pair for each colleague: "favorite_study_spot"
b) Update the "number of pets" for one colleague
c) Create a list of all the favorite colors your colleagues mentioned

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
# a) Add favorite_study_spot
for colleague in colleague_info:
    colleague_info[colleague]["favorite_study_spot"] = "library"  # Default value

# b) Update number of pets for one colleague
colleague_info["Alice"]["number_of_pets"] = 3

# c) List of favorite colors
favorite_colors = [info["favorite_color"] for info in colleague_info.values()]

print("Updated dictionary:", colleague_info)
print("Favorite colors:", favorite_colors)
```

## Part 3: Data Analysis

Let's use our data structures to perform some simple analysis.

### Task 5: Basic Statistics

Calculate and print the following:

a) The average number of pets among your colleagues
b) The name of the colleague who got the most sleep last night

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
# a) Average number of pets
avg_pets = sum(info["number_of_pets"] for info in colleague_info.values()) / len(colleague_info)
print(f"Average number of pets: {avg_pets:.2f}")

# b) Colleague who got the most sleep
most_sleep_colleague = max(colleague_info, key=lambda x: colleague_info[x].get("hours_of_sleep", 0))
print(f"Colleague who got the most sleep: {most_sleep_colleague}")
```

### Task 6: Data Filtering

Create a new list containing only the colleagues who have at least one pet.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
colleagues_with_pets = [name for name, info in colleague_info.items() if info["number_of_pets"] > 0]
print("Colleagues with pets:", colleagues_with_pets)
```

## Part 4: Fun with Random Selections

Let's add a fun element to our exercise using the `random` module. Before we dive into the main task, let's look at how we can use the random library to select random items from a dictionary.

### Example: Random Selection from a Dictionary

Here's a simple example of how to select random items from a dictionary:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import random

# Sample dictionary
fruit_colors = {
    "apple": "red",
    "banana": "yellow",
    "grape": "purple",
    "kiwi": "brown",
    "orange": "orange"
}

# Select a single random key-value pair
random_fruit, random_color = random.choice(list(fruit_colors.items()))
print(f"Randomly selected fruit: {random_fruit}")
print(f"Its color: {random_color}")

# To get just a random key:
random_fruit = random.choice(list(fruit_colors.keys()))
print(f"Another randomly selected fruit: {random_fruit}")

# To select multiple random items:
num_selections = 3
random_fruits = random.sample(list(fruit_colors.keys()), num_selections)
print(f"Randomly selected {num_selections} fruits: {random_fruits}")
```

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Convert a dictionary to a list of key-value pairs or keys
2. Use `random.choice()` to select a single random item from a list
3. Use `random.sample()` to select multiple unique random items from a list

Note: `random.choice()` selects a single item, while `random.sample()` can select multiple unique items. For our snack-sharing task below, `random.sample()` might be more useful!


### Task 7: Random Snack Sharing

Create a function that randomly selects a colleague to share their snack with another random colleague. Print out the results as "Name will share [snack] with Name".

```python
#| echo: true
def assign_random_snacks(colleague_info):
    # Your code here
    print(f"{sharer} will share {snack} with {receiver}")

# Test your function
assign_random_snacks(colleague_info)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
def assign_random_snacks(colleague_info):
    names = list(colleague_info.keys())
    [sharer, receiver] = random.sample(names, 2)
    print(f"{sharer} will share {colleague_info[sharer]['preferred_study_snack']} with {receiver}")

# Test the function
assign_random_snacks(colleague_info)
```

## Conclusion

Great job completing this exercise! You've practiced creating and manipulating lists and dictionaries, performed basic data analysis, and even created a fun random snack-sharing function. These skills will be invaluable as you continue your journey in Python programming and data science.

Remember, the key to mastering these concepts is practice. Feel free to modify this exercise with your own data or ideas to further reinforce your learning.
