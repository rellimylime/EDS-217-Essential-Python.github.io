## Introduction

This end-of-day session is focused on using pandas for loading, visualizing, and analyzing marine microplastics data. This session is designed to help you become more comfortable with the pandas library, equipping you with the skills needed to perform data analysis effectively.

The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://noaa.gov/), via its [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) has an entire section related to marine microplastics -- that is, microplastics found in water — at [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics).

We will be working with a recent download of the entire marine microplastics dataset. The url for this data is located here:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
url = 'https://ucsb.box.com/shared/static/dnnu59jsnkymup6o8aaovdywrtxiy3a9.csv'
```

**Objective:** Write your own notebook that contains a simple DataFrame exploration as well as some basic grouping, filtering, and aggregation, and visualization... all within the pandas library.

## 1. Loading the Data

**Objective**: Learn to load data into a pandas DataFrame and display the first few records.

### Task 1.1 Import the pandas library.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
```

### Task 1.2: Load the dataset into a dataframe named `df` from the provided URL into a pandas DataFrame. 

:::{.callout-tip}
I've already taken a look at this data set and noticed there was a column with sample date called `Date`. We can use the `parse_date` option of the `read_csv()` function to convert values in the `Dates` column of the csv into datetime objects in pandas while reading the file. 
:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
df = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates=['Date'], date_format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
```

### Task 1.3: Display the first five rows of the DataFrame to get an initial understanding of the data structure.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
print(df.head())
```

## 2. Exploring the Data

### Task 2.1: Display summary statistics of the dataset to understand the central tendency and variability.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
summary_statistics = df.describe()
print(summary_statistics)
```

### Task 2.2: Check the data types of each column and identify if there are any missing values.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
df.info()
```

## 3. Grouping the Data

### Task 3.1: Create a groupby object called `oceans` that groups the data in df according to the value of the Oceans column.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
oceans = df.groupby(['Oceans'])
```

### Task 3.2: Determine the total number of Measurements taken from each Ocean.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
print(oceans['Measurement'].count())
```

### Task 3.3: Determine the average value of Measurement taken from each Ocean.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
print(oceans['Measurement'].mean())
```

## 4. Filtering the Data and Aggregating the data

### Task 4.1: Filter the data to a new df (called df2) that only contains rows where the Unit of measurement is `pieces/m3`

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
df2 = df[df['Unit'] == 'pieces/m3']
```

### Task 4.2: Use the groupby and the max() command to determine the Maximum value of pieces/m3 measured for each Ocean

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# Instructor code
print(df2.groupby(['Oceans'])['Measurement'].max())
```

## 5. Simple Plots in pandas

### Task 5.1: Make a histogram of the latitude of every sample in your filtered dataframe using the DataFrame plot command.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
df2['Latitude'].hist()
```


### Task 5.2: Make a new dataframe (`df3`) from your filtered dataframe (`df2`) that contains only rows where Measurement is greater than zero. 

:::{.callout-important}
Using .copy() when filtering a dataframe ensures that you're working with a new DataFrame, not a view of the original. This is especially important when you're filtering data and then modifying the result, which is common in data science workflows.
:::


```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

df3 = df2[df2['Measurement'] > 0].copy()

```

### Task 5.3 Create a new column in `df3` that contains the log10 of Measurements. 

:::{.callout-tip}
The numpy library has a `log10()` function that you will find useful for this step!
:::


```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import numpy as np
df3['log10Measurement'] = np.log10(df3['Measurement'])

```

### Task 5.4 Make a histogram of the log-transformed values in `df3`


```{python}
#| echo: true
# Your code here
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
df3['log10Measurement'].hist()
```

## Conclusion

🎉 Congratulations, you're officially doing python data science! 🎉

Be sure to save your notebook and add comments and reflections at the end of your notebook before heading out for the day.
