## Introduction

In this collaborative coding exercise, we'll explore Pandas Series, a fundamental data structure in the Pandas library. You'll work together to create, manipulate, and analyze Series objects.

## Resources

Here's our course cheatsheet on pandas `Series`:

- [Pandas Series Cheatsheet](../cheatsheets/pandas_series.qmd)

Feel free to refer to this cheatsheet throughout the exercise if you need a quick reminder about syntax or functionality.

## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and create a sample Series.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample Series
fruits = pd.Series(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'], name='Fruits')
print(fruits)
```

## Exercise 1: Creating a Series

Work together to create a Series representing the prices of the fruits in our `fruits` Series. Use these values:

> apple: $0.5, banana: $0.3, cherry: $1.0, date: $1.5, elderberry: $2.0


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| 
# Create a Series called 'prices' with the same index as 'fruits'
# Use these prices: apple: $0.5, banana: $0.3, cherry: $1.0, date: $1.5, elderberry: $2.0
prices = pd.Series([0.5, 0.3, 1.0, 2.5, 3.0], index=fruits.values, name='Prices')
print(prices)
```


## Exercise 2: Finding Maximum and Minimum Values

Collaborate to explore Series indexing methods:

1. Find the most expensive fruit using `.idxmax()`
2. Find the least expensive fruit using `.idxmin()`  
3. Calculate the total price of all fruits using `.sum()`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

# Answer for Exercise 2
# 1. Find the most expensive fruit using .idxmax()
most_expensive = prices.idxmax()

# 2. Find the least expensive fruit using .idxmin()
least_expensive = prices.idxmin()

# 3. Calculate the total price using .sum()
total_price = prices.sum()

print(f"Most expensive fruit: {most_expensive}")
print(f"Least expensive fruit: {least_expensive}")
print(f"Total price: ${total_price:.2f}")
```


## Exercise 3: Basic Series Analysis

Work as a team to practice basic Series methods:

1. What is the average price of the fruits? (use `.mean()`)
2. What is the price range? Calculate: maximum price minus minimum price

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

# Answer for Exercise 3
# 1. Calculate the average price using .mean()
average_price = prices.mean()

# 2. Calculate the price range (max - min)
price_range = prices.max() - prices.min()

print(f"Average price: ${average_price:.2f}")
print(f"Price range: ${price_range:.2f}")
```

## Conclusion

In this collaborative exercise, you've practiced the essential Pandas Series operations:

âœ… **Series Creation**: Built Series with custom indices  
âœ… **Key Methods**: Used `.idxmax()`, `.idxmin()`, `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.max()`, `.min()`  
âœ… **Data Analysis**: Applied Series methods to real data problems  

These core skills prepare you for the end-of-day practice and future DataFrame work!

## Discussion Questions

1. What's the difference between `.max()` and `.idxmax()`? When would you use each?
2. How do Series operations compare to working with Python lists?
3. Which Series method did you find most useful?
