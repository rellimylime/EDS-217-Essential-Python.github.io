[Matrices]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text-m}
A matrix is a table of values (multiple vectors in combination). A vector, therefore, can be thought of as a matrix with a single column. 

<br>

- **Dimensions:** the size of the matrix, in rows x columns (*m* x *n*)
- **Elements:** values in a matrix, often denoted symbolically with a subscript where the first number is the *row* and the second number is the *column* (e.g. $a_{34}$ indicates the element in row 3, column 4)

::: {.notes}
We can write systems of equations in matrix form as $Ax=b$, where:

- $A$ is the coefficient matrix
- $x$ is the vector of variables
- $b$ is the constant vector

1. Identify coefficients to form matrix $A$, where each row corresponds to the coefficients of one equation:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & -8 \\
  1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}$$

2. Form the variable vector $x$ which contains the variables of the system:

$$x = \begin{bmatrix}
 x \\
  y
\end{bmatrix}$$

3. Form the constant vector $b$
$$b = \begin{bmatrix}
 5 \\
 10
\end{bmatrix}$$

The Leslie matrix is one of the most well-known ways to describe the growth of populations (and their projected age distribution), in which a population is:

- closed to migration, 
- growing in an unlimited environment, 
- and where only one sex, usually the female, is considered.

::: {.notes}
The Leslie matrix (L) will be a 3x3 matrix since we have three stages (Eggs, Larvae, Adults).

Each column represents an age class at time $t$

1. **Fecundity (Top Row):** The third element of the top row is 600 because adult females contribute to the number of eggs in the next generation.

2. **Survival Rates (Sub-diagonal):**
- The first element in the second row (0.2) represents the probability of an egg surviving to become a larva.
- The second element in the third row (0.08) represents the probability of a larva surviving to become an adult female.

- Each column is the age class at time $t$ and each row is the age class at time $t+1$
- Each entry represents a transition, or change in the # of individuals, from one age class to the next
- Fertilities are always in the first row, and represent the contributions to newborns from reproduction 
- Survival probabilities are always in the subdiagonal and represent transitions from one age class to the next
- All other entries are 0 because no other transitions are possible -- individuals cannot remain in the same age class from one year to the next, nor can they skip or repeat age classes
