## Overview

In this session, we will be exploring List and Dictionary comprehensions together. Live coding is a great way to learn programming as it allows you to see the process of writing code in real-time, including how to deal with unexpected issues and debug errors.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of comprehensions in Python.
- Apply comprehensions in practical examples.
- Develop the ability to troubleshoot and debug in a live setting.


## Overview

This session introduces list and dictionary comprehensions, providing a comparison to traditional control flow methods. The goal is to help students understand the advantages of using comprehensions in Python and to practice writing their own.

## 1. Setting Up Your Notebook (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Start by having students set up their Jupyter notebook with markdown headers. This helps organize the session into distinct sections, making it easier for them to follow along and refer back to their work later.

### Instructions:

1. **Create a new Jupyter notebook** or open an existing one for this session.
2. **Add markdown cells** with the following headers, using `##` for each header.
3. **Place code cells between the headers** where you'll write and execute your code.

### Header Texts:

- **First markdown cell:**

  ```markdown
  ## Review: Traditional Control Flow Approaches
  ```

- **Second markdown cell:**

  ```markdown
  ## Introduction to List Comprehensions
  ```

- **Third markdown cell:**

  ```markdown
  ## Introduction to Dictionary Comprehensions
  ```

- **Fourth markdown cell:**

  ```markdown
  ## Using Conditional Logic in Comprehensions
  ```

- **Fifth markdown cell:**

  ```markdown
  ## Summary and Best Practices
  ```

- **Sixth markdown cell:**

  ```markdown
  ## Reflections
  ```


## Session Format

### Introduction

- Brief discussion about the topic and its importance in data science.

### Demonstration

- I will demonstrate code examples live. Follow along and write the code into your own Jupyter notebook.

### Practice

- You will have the opportunity to try exercises on your own to apply what you've learned.

### Q&A

- We will have a Q&A session at the end where you can ask specific questions about the code, concepts, or issues encountered during the session.

## After the Session

- Review your notes and try to replicate the exercises on your own.

- Experiment with the code by modifying parameters or adding new features to deepen your understanding.

- Check out our class [comprehensions](../cheatsheets/comprehensions.qmd) cheatsheet.
