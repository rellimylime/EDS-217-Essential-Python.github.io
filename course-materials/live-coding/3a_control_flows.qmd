*An enormously complex tangle of piping and valves with numerous loops and on/off spigots that control the flow.* [MidJourney 5](https://www.midjourney.com/jobs/8e742ff8-f630-4021-9059-9dbd52e0ee0c?index=0)

## Overview

In this session, we will be exploring Control Flows - `if-elif`, `for`, `while` and other ways of altering the flow of code execution. Live coding is a great way to learn programming as it allows you to see the process of writing code in real-time, including how to deal with unexpected issues and debug errors.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of flow control in Python.
- Apply `if-elif-else` constructions in practical examples.
- Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through collections.
- Develop the ability to troubleshoot and debug in a live setting.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this session, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Make sure JupyterLab is up and running on your machine.
   - Open a new Jupyter notebook where you can write your own code as we go along.
   - Make sure to name the notebook something informative so you can refer back to it later.

2. **Setting Up Your Notebook**:

    Please set up your Jupyter Notebook with the following structure. We'll fill in the content together during our session.

```
    ### Introduction to Control Flows

    ### Loops

    #### For Loops

    ### Applying Control Flows in Data Science

    <insert code cell below> 
    
    ### Conclusion

   <insert code cell below> 
    
```
    Leave code cells empty between each section. We'll fill these together during the live coding session.
    Save your notebook with an appropriate name, such as "Control_Flow_Live_Coding.ipynb".

Remember, we'll be coding together, so don't worry about filling in the content now. Just set up the structure, and we'll dive into the details during our session!

2. **Participation**:
   - Try to code along with me during the session.
   - Feel free to ask questions at any time. Remember, if you have a question, others probably do too!

3. **Resources**:
   - I will be sharing snippets of code and notes. Make sure to take your own notes and save snippets in your notebook for future reference.
   - Check out our class [control flows](../cheatsheets/control_flows.qmd) cheatsheet.

## Session Format

### Introduction

- A brief discussion about the topic in Python programming and its importance in data science.

### Demonstration

- I will demonstrate code examples live. Follow along and write the code into your own Jupyter notebook.

### Practice

- You will have the opportunity to try exercises on your own to apply what you've learned.

### Q&A

- We will have a Q&A session at the end where you can ask specific questions about the code, concepts, or issues encountered during the session.

## After the Session

- Review your notes and try to replicate the exercises on your own.

- Experiment with the code by modifying parameters or adding new features to deepen your understanding.

- Check out our class [flow control](../cheatsheets/control_flows.qmd) cheatsheet.
