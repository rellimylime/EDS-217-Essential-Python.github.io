*An enormously complex tangle of piping and valves with numerous loops and on/off spigots that control the flow.* [MidJourney 5](https://www.midjourney.com/jobs/8e742ff8-f630-4021-9059-9dbd52e0ee0c?index=0)

## Overview

In this session, we will be exploring Control Flows - `if-elif`, `for`, `while` and other ways of altering the flow of code execution. Live coding is a great way to learn programming as it allows you to see the process of writing code in real-time, including how to deal with unexpected issues and debug errors.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of flow control in Python.
- Apply `if-elif-else` constructions in practical examples.
- Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through collections.
- Develop the ability to troubleshoot and debug in a live setting.

## Getting Started

Before we begin our interactive session, please follow these steps to set up your Jupyter Notebook:

1. Open JupyterLab and create a new notebook:
   - Click on the `+` button in the top left corner
   - Select `Python 3.11.0` from the Notebook options

2. Rename your notebook:
   - Right-click on the `Untitled.ipynb` tab
   - Select "Rename"
   - Name your notebook with the format: `Session_XY_Topic.ipynb`
     (Replace X with the day number and Y with the session number)

3. Add a title cell:
   - In the first cell of your notebook, change the cell type to "Markdown"
   - Add the following content (replace the placeholders with the actual information):

```markdown
# Day X: Session Y - [Session Topic]

[Link to session webpage]

Date: [Current Date]
```

4. Set up your notebook:

    Please set up your Jupyter Notebook with the following structure. We'll fill in the content together during our session.

Remember, we'll be coding together, so don't worry about filling in the content now. Just set up the structure, and we'll dive into the details during our session!

2. **Participation**:
   - Try to code along with me during the session.
   - Feel free to ask questions at any time. Remember, if you have a question, others probably do too!

3. **Resources**:
   - I will be sharing snippets of code and notes. Make sure to take your own notes and save snippets in your notebook for future reference.
   - Check out our class [control flows](../cheatsheets/control_flows.qmd) cheatsheet.

## Session Format

### Introduction

- A brief discussion about the topic in Python programming and its importance in data science.

### Demonstration

- I will demonstrate code examples live. Follow along and write the code into your own Jupyter notebook.

### Practice

- You will have the opportunity to try exercises on your own to apply what you've learned.

### Q&A

- We will have a Q&A session at the end where you can ask specific questions about the code, concepts, or issues encountered during the session.

## After the Session

- Review your notes and try to replicate the exercises on your own.

- Experiment with the code by modifying parameters or adding new features to deepen your understanding.

- Check out our class [flow control](../cheatsheets/control_flows.qmd) cheatsheet.
